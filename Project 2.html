<h2>
Introduction
<p>I have designed and 3D printed a water bottle cage for my bike that has a built-in tool storage compartment. I used Autodesk Fusion 360 to create my design,
 which I had some previous experience in but I now have a much better understanding of it.
<br>
I chose to do 3D printing because I have an interest in it and I like being able to design something on a computer and then bring it to life. I decided to make a
 bottle cage because I wanted to make something useful and something that would interest me.
</p>
</h2>


<h3>
Objectives
<p>
•	To design and 3D print an object that would be useful.
<br>
•	To improve my understanding of the design and print process 
<br>
•	To consolidate my current knowledge and skills in Autodesk Fusion 360 
<br>
•	To learn more advanced techniques that would allow me to create more complex designs
</p>
</h3>

<h4>
Method
	<p>I started by looking at examples of different bottle cage designs to help me figure out what I wanted. I decided to base the design on the picture below.
	</p>
	<br>
	<div class="appimages">
		<img src="Custom race plus.png" alt="Bottle cage design" style="width:600px">
		
		<div class="text">I based my design on this bottle cage.</div>
	</div>
	<br>
	<p>
	I then had to consider the best approach for designing a cylindrical shape like this.
	It is easy to create prisms and planar shapes in Fusion 360, but more complex shapes like this are much more difficult. 
	My initial approach was to create a solid cylinder with the correct dimensions, draw a 2D sketch of the profile I wanted 
	and then extrude that through the cylinder and keep the intersection of the two bodies. This however did not allow me to 
	create the form I wanted, so after lots of experimenting and YouTube tutorials I found a way using the sheet metal design 
	environment to draw a 2D sketch and wrap it around a cylinder.
	<br>
	When the design was finished it was printed out in ABS plastic. The print was not very successful however because there were 
	too many supports and they were hard to get to and the tool compartment walls were too thin, so when removing the supports the walls broke.
	</p>

<h5>
	Results

	<div class="appimages">
		<img src="Bottle Cage V1.JPG" alt="The first print of my design" style="width:600px">
		
		<div class="text">V1 with most of the supports out.</div>
	</div>
	
	<p>
		The final design has not yet been printed so I will update this when I find out how it goes.
	</p>
