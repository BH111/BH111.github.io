<h2>
Introduction
<p>I made a soundboard app that allows you to record sounds and replay them by pressing different buttons. After researching how apps were made and the different tools available, I decided to use Thunkable classic to create my app.
<br>
I chose to make an app because I was interested in app development and wanted to learn more about it. We use apps so often and I was interested in how they work and how they are made.
</p>
</h2>


<h3>
Objectives
<p>
•	To create a functional app
<br>
•	To learn how to use Thunkable
<br>

•	To learn more about how apps work
</p>
</h3>

<h4>
Method
	<p>I started my project by doing some research into what tools are used to make apps.
	 I chose to use Thunkable X because it was simple and easy to learn, which was ideal for me because I had no experience and 
	 not much time. I completed their tutorials first and then started to make my own app, but I ran into a few problems; I 
	couldn’t find any way to record sound using Thunkable X, and I couldn’t do alternatives like open a sound file from the phone’s storage.
	<br>
	<br>
	I eventually stopped using Thunkable because of these limitations and started using MIT App Inventor, which was a lot more powerful. 
	After learning how to use MIT App Inventor I swapped 
	again to Thunkable <em>Classic</em>, which is an adapted version of MIT App Inventor with a nicer user interface and the same flexibility. 
	</p>

	</div>
	
	<p>
		The images above show the two screens of my app. The home screen shows nine buttons that can be pressed to play a 
		sound and long-pressed to swap to the edit screen for that sound. In the edit screen a sound can be recorded and 
		set as the source for the button or the source can be set to a URL. 
		The button colour and text can also be changed in the edit screen.
		<br>
		<br>
		The .apk file for my app can be downloaded <a href="soundboard app.apk" download>here</a>.

	Discussion
	<p>
		I achieved my objectives and made a functional soundboard app that you can customise by adding your own sounds. 
		These sounds can be recorded from within my app or can be set to a URL source. The nine sound buttons can 
		be customised by changing the label and colour. I have also gained a better understanding of how apps work and how they are made.
		<br>
		<br>
		If I had more time I would learn Java and write my app in Android Studio. I would like to add a save option to the sounds,
		which would be easier if I wrote it in Java. I tried to do 
		this in Thunkable classic, Thunkable X and MIT App Inventor but found it was impossible. I would also like to make the UI 
		neater.
